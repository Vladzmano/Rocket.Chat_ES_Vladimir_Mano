### Hello & Welcome ###

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to test my capacities; this challenge was entertaining.
I learned a lot about how to use Rocket Chat and the possibilities that this open source offers.

As you requested, I'm sharing the access credentials of a user created on my Rocket. Chat server.

Please notice that the access URL may change due to the web server used to expose the local server to the internet (ngrok) renewing on every startup.
Don't worry, I can provide you with the new URL segment you need, since Ngrok Only changes the first four characters on every reboot.
